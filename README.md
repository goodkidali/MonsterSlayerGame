# Monster Slayer Game
### Created using Vue.js

In this simple game, you as the player must defeat the monster. Each attack deals a randomly generated amount of damage, and the monster attacks back after each move. You can use your turn to
attack, heal, surrender, or special attack (which can only be used every 3 rounds).

Good luck!
